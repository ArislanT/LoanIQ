# LoanIQ
We are building a financial decision tool that helps users understand both the meaning and consequences if their financial actions before they commit to them. The app uses familiar interface where the users input loan and expense information, but we additional show real-time tradeoffs such as total interest, payoff timelines, and missed payments.
